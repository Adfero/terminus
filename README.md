========

A Drush-bases CLI interface to the existing pseudoproxy into the Pantheon core API. This is being developed initially to support some enterprise and partner edge cases (Vodaware, Kalabox), but we would like to implement it for public release on drupal.org.

TODO
====

- Implement rate-metering on site creation.
- Implement limits on hostname creation.
